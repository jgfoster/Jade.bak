Jade.bak
========

In order to reduce the repository size (877 MB to 206 MB!), `git-filter-repo` has been used to purge zip and exe files (see https://github.com/jgfoster/Jade.bak/issues/186). Jade has been moved to https://github.com/jgfoster/Jade (its old name) and you will need to fork it again in order to contribute. I apologize for the disruption but this seems to me to otherwise be an improvement.
